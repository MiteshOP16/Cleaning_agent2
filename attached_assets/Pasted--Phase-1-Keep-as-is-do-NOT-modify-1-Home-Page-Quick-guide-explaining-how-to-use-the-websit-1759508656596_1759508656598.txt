âœ… Phase 1 (Keep as-is, do NOT modify):
	1.	Home Page â€“ Quick guide explaining how to use the website.
	2.	Upload Data â€“ User uploads dataset.
	3.	Schema Fetching Section â€“ Detects column schema; option to update manually or upload schema JSON.
	4.	Column-wise Analysis â€“ For each column, user sees:
	â€¢	Key points
	â€¢	Missing values
	â€¢	Outliers
	â€¢	Distributions
	â€¢	Cleaning recommendations
	5.	Cleaning Wizard â€“ Provides multiple cleaning techniques with before/after graphs.
	6.	AI Assistant â€“ FAQs on cleaning; save chats for better responses.
	7.	Report Generation â€“ Generates a PDF report based on applied steps.
	8.	Undo/Redo Cleaning Logs â€“ Tracks all cleaning actions.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2 (New Features to Add):

1. Visualization Section (place it before AI Assistant):
	â€¢	Let user select multiple columns.
	â€¢	Let user choose graph type (bar, line, scatter, etc.).
	â€¢	All graphs must update in real time to reflect cleaned data.
	â€¢	Graphs must be static images and can be pushed into the PDF report.

2. Data Export Options:
	â€¢	Allow users to download the cleaned dataset in CSV format.
	â€¢	Keep report export in PDF only.

3. Enhanced Cleaning Features (inside Cleaning Wizard):
	â€¢	Improve handling of:
	â€¢	Missing values
	â€¢	Outliers
	â€¢	Add data validation and formatting checks before final export.

4. Anomaly Detection Section:
	â€¢	Detect anomalies in each column.
	â€¢	Show all detected anomalies (not random samples).
	â€¢	Allow anomalies to be added into the PDF report.

5. Final Report Enhancements:
	â€¢	Add a preview of the cleaned dataset inside the report section (before export).
	â€¢	Ensure report includes:
	â€¢	All applied cleaning steps
	â€¢	Detected anomalies
	â€¢	Visualizations (as static images)

ðŸ”¹ Tech Requirements:
	â€¢	Continue using Streamlit + Python.
	â€¢	You may use other libraries where needed:
	â€¢	Plotly, Altair, or Matplotlib â†’ for visualizations
	â€¢	Scikit-learn, PyOD, or Pandas-based methods â†’ for anomaly detection
	â€¢	Pandas, NumPy, PyArrow â†’ for cleaning improvements

â¸»

âš  Rules:
	â€¢	Do NOT modify or remove any Phase 1 functionality.
	â€¢	Only add Phase 2 features.
	â€¢	Ensure Phase 2 integrates seamlessly with existing workflow.

ðŸ‘‰ This is the final instruction. Generate the Streamlit + Python code implementing PhaseÂ 2Â asÂ described.
